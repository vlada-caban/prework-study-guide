A study guide for course pre-work. 
As a student of Bootcamp, it is challenging to keep track of all the information we learn. 
I created study guide to help me keep track of my notes for topics I learn. 
I also used it as a tool to learn basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as I learned how to use GitHub.
